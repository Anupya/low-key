A web app that uses Spotify API to help unknown artists get recognized.

# Description

Low Key is a web app that allows unknown artists who have been squashed by Facebook's and Spotify's algorithms to find the audience they've dreamed of.

Their music is displayed in a randomized order to users, who can like, dislike or save it for later. A like increases your score by one and a dislike decreases it by one. This allows users to see new music by underground artists, and underground artists to get their music out to a wider audience.

# How it was made

We built the website using PHP, HTML, CSS and Javascript. We used Spotify's API to embed the player and randomize the songs that come up.
